## Using React Native with Expo
To get started follow the guide found [here](https://docs.expo.io/) to get the expo cli running.
Once you have expo installed, pull this repo and run 
```npm install```

```expo start``` 
and scan the QR code the appears in the Metro Bundler in chrome.

Voila, you are all set up for testing.
